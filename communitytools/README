Sphene Community Tools are django applications designed to be easily
pluggable into any django project.


## Directories

- static/	Static media files which contain images and css.

## Requirements

- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) 1.0 or later
- Python >= 2.4 (Use >= 2.5 if you need wiki diffs with unicode support)
- [PyCrypto](http://sf.net/projects/pycrypto) - (e.g. debian package python-crypto)
- [Python Imaging Library (PIL)](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

## Installation


### Python library path

You need to add sphenecoll/ to your python include path and
static/ needs to be served from your django installation.
(static/sphene/ is enough)

### Maintenance cron job (Optional)

To recaulcate heat for forum threads and similar, you should add the following
cronjob to run once a day (or similar)

    echo -e "from sphene.community.signals import trigger_maintenance\ntrigger_maintenance()" | ./manage.py shell --plain

### Cache

SCT makes use of django caching framework - it is therefore advised to 
configure CACHE_BACKEND django setting & co.
look at the [django caching documentation](http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/cache/)

## Examples

There are currently two examples - a very simplistic 'simpleproject' in the
examples/ directory (see examples/simpleproject/README) and a more
sophisticated example called CommunityDraft which i recommend as using as a base for your
own projects (if you start from scratch).
See <http://sct.sphene.net/wiki/show/CommunityDraft/> for details.
